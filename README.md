## User Stories
As a user I would like to plan beforehand before going out, I want to:
<ul>
<li>To be able to check if my location going to rain soon</li>
<li>The weather condition of my travel destination</li>
<li>If the weather is too humid</li>
<li>If I require to cancel the appointment beforehand</li>
</ul>

## UI / UX
This project I started with a mobile first design approach as it is much easier compare to desktop first approach. I started creating mockups wireframe on paper for mobile only. I then slowly move into creating mockups and wireframes for medium and larger screens. The design of the site is fully design by myself, showcasing smooth layout and interactive for most devices.
Milstones had to be set in order to finish this project Below are steps by steps on the journey of clear goals that required to be achieved for this website.
